Welcome to my personal website! I am a data scientist passionate about developing robust and explainable models for safe and fair applications in medicine and neuroscience. My expertise lies in machine learning, neuro-image analysis (M/EEG, MRI, PET), software development, and applied statistics.

At NRU, my primary focus is developing new and evaluating existing models for brain-age prediction. Brain age is a summary measure that is thought to reflect aging-related biology in the brain. My current research focuses on assessing the accuracy, reliability, and validity of pre-trained publicly available methods for structural MRI-based brain-age estimation. Such evaluation is crucial to establish brain age as a clinically useful biomarker. Furthermore, I am using machine learning to model age-related changes in serotonin 2A receptor binding to improve existing methods for MRI-based brain-age estimation.
