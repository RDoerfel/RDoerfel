I am a biomedical engineer passionate about developing robust and explainable models for safe and fair applications in medicine and neuroscience. Generally, I'm interested in applied problems in the combined fields of computer science, mathematics and neuroscience. My expertise lies in machine learning, neuro-image analysis (M/EEG, MRI, PET), software development, and applied statistics. My current research focuses on developing and validating biomarkers for biological brain aging.

Do not hesitate to reach out if you have any questions or want to collaborate. I'm always open to new ideas and projects. Specifically I'm looking for students with a computer science background to work on projects in the field of neuroimaging and machine learning.

### Short Bio
I have a Bachelor of Science in Biomedical Engineering from the Technical University of Ilmenau, Germany, and a Master of Science from the Technical University Denmark and Copenhagen University. During my Bachelor's I did an internship at the MEG Lab at the [MGH/HST Athinoula A. Martinos Center for Biomedical Imaging](https://www.martinos.org) where I worked on real-time movement estimation and correction for MEG measurements. A significant part of this work has been contributed to the open-source software [MNE-CPP](https://mne-cpp.org). Additionally, I've been granted the BND Summer of Code scholarship to contribute to this project. 

During my Master's, I worked as a student software engineer at [Demant A/S](https://www.demant.com), a globally leading hearing aid provider. Additionally, I did research projects at the [Neurobiology Research Unit, Rigshospitalet](https://nru.dk/index.php) with a research stay at the [Centre for Psychiatry Research, Karolinska Institutet](https://ki.se/en/cns/centre-for-psychiatry-research). I continued this appointment as a research assistant after graduating and am now enrolled as a PhD student at those institutions. Further, I'm a visitin PhD student at the [Department of Computer Science, University of Copenhagen](https://di.ku.dk/english/).
