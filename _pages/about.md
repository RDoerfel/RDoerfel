Welcome to my personal website! I am a data scientist with a passion for developing robust and explainable models for safe and fair applications in medicine. My expertise lies in machine learning, neuro-image analysis, software development, and applied statistics. I have a strong background in medical (neuro-) imaging, with particular focus on Magnetenecphalography (MEG), Positron Emission Tomography (PET), and Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI). 

I hold a Master's degree in Biomedical Engineering from the Technical University of Denmark & University of Copenhagen, specializing in machine learning, medical imaging, and data analysis. Further I received a Bachelor's degree in Biomedical Engineering from the Technical University of Denmark, focusing on biomagnetism, signal processing, and medical imaging as well.
