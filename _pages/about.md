I am a biomedical engineer interested in applied problems in the combined fields of neuroimaging, machine learning, and aging. My expertise lies in machine learning, neuro-image analysis (M/EEG, MRI, PET), software development, and applied statistics. Currently, my research focuses on developing and validating biomarkers for biological brain aging.

Feel free to reach out if you have any questions or want to collaborate. I'm always open to new ideas and projects, particularly seeking students with a computer science background to work on neuroimaging and machine learning projects.

### Short Bio
I hold a Bachelor of Science in Biomedical Engineering from the Technical University of Ilmenau, Germany, and a Master of Science from the Technical University Denmark and Copenhagen University. During my bachelor's, I interned at the MEG Lab at the [MGH/HST Athinoula A. Martinos Center for Biomedical Imaging](https://www.martinos.org), focusing on real-time movement estimation and correction for MEG measurements. A significant part of this work contributed to the open-source software [MNE-CPP](https://mne-cpp.org), supported by the BND Summer of Code scholarship.

In my master's program, I worked as a student software engineer at [Demant A/S](https://www.demant.com), a leading global hearing aid provider, and conducted research projects at the [Neurobiology Research Unit, Rigshospitalet](https://nru.dk/index.php), with a research stay at the [Centre for Psychiatry Research, Karolinska Institutet](https://ki.se/en/cns/centre-for-psychiatry-research). I continued as a research assistant after graduation and am currently pursuing a PhD at these institutions. Additionally, I am a visiting PhD student at the [Department of Computer Science, University of Copenhagen](https://di.ku.dk/english/).
