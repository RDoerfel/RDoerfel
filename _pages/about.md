Welcome to my personal website! I am a data scientist with a passion for developing robust and explainable models for safe and fair applications in medicine. My expertise lies in machine learning, neuro-image analysis, software development, and applied statistics.

I hold a Master's degree in Biomedical Engineering from the Technical University of Denmark & University of Copenhagen, specializing in machine learning, medical image analysis, and data analysis. My thesis focused on multimodal brain age prediction and feature selection, comparing machine learning models using MRI and PET-derived measures.

With proficiency in Python, Matlab, C++, and shell/bash scripting, I am well-equipped to tackle complex projects in the field. In my previous roles as a Research Assistant, Student Researcher, and Student Worker, I gained valuable experience in statistical modeling and machine learning on neuroimaging data, software engineering, and embedded software.
