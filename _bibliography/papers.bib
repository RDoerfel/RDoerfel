	abstract = {Background: Brain age prediction algorithms using structural magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) aim to assess the biological age of the human brain. The difference between a person's chronological age and the estimated brain age is thought to reflect deviations from a normal aging trajectory, indicating a slower, or accelerated, biological aging process. Several pre-trained software packages for predicting brain age are publicly available. In this study we perform a head-to-head comparison of such packages with respect to 1) predictive accuracy, 2) test-retest reliability, and 3) the ability to track age progression over time. Methods: We evaluated the five brain age prediction packages: brainageR, DeepBrainNet, brainage, ENIGMA, and pyment. The accuracy and test-retest reliability were assessed on MRI data from 372 healthy people, aged between 18.4 and 86.2 years (mean 38.7 +/- 17.5 years). Results: All packages showed significant correlations between predicted brain age and chronological age (r = 0.66 to 0.97, p {\textless} 0.001), with pyment displaying the strongest correlation. The mean absolute error was between 3.56 (pyment) and 9.54 years (ENIGMA). brainageR and pyment were superior in terms of reliability (ICC values between 0.94 - 0.98), as well as predicting age progression over a longer time span. Conclusion: Of the five packages, pyment and brainageR consistently showed the highest accuracy and test-retest reliability.},
