This package provides a set of convenient functions to create highly customized scientific figures in Python. The package is based on the matplotlib library and provides a set of functions to create publication-ready figures. This package is mainly developed for my own publications as the style is tailored towards my own liking. The code is available on [GitHub](https://github.com/RDoerfel/plotting).
