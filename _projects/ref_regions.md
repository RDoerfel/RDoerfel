This project aims to provide a lightweight python package to create reference regions for positron emission tomography (PET) analysis. The package includes functions to extract reference regions from T1-weighted MRI images and to create binary masks for these regions. The package is designed to be user-friendly and can be easily integrated into existing pipelines for PET image processing. It is based on [FastSurfer](https://github.com/Deep-MI/FastSurfer) The code is available on [GitHub](https://github.com/RDoerfel/pet_reference_regions).
