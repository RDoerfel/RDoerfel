The aim of this project is to provide implementations of various deep learning models, mainly to familarize myself with specific arcitectures and the PyTorch framework. The code is written in Python using the PyTorch library. The models are implemented in a modular way, allowing for easy customization and extension. The project is hosted on [GitHub](https://github.com/RDoerfel/DL_playground).
