The Evaluating Rapamycin in Alzheimer's disease using Positron emission tomography (ERAP) project aims to evaluate the effects of Rapamycin on Alzheimer's disease using Positron emission tomography (PET) imaging. I am the data scientist for this project and I am responsible for the data analysis and the development of the data processing pipeline. The project is a run by clinical trial group [Sigray Lab](https://sigray-lab.github.io/sigray_lab_website/). As part of this project, I'm building processing pipelines to analyse a large range of imaging data, including PET, MRI, and CT images.
